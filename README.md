# Tetris

# Project Overview
I have created the tetris game in java as a project to mainly get used to git integration and the integration with github. The main idea was to use github so the project can be shown on my portfolio. The overview of the game is that blocks are raining down on the board and you use the aswd keys to manouvre those blocks to fit. If you form a full line withh the blocks, the line disapears and then you gain 10 points. After a certain level of points the game becomes increasingly faster and more difficult.

# Running the code
I used the BlueJ IDE to run my code. This was primarily because of the simplicity of the project I began with useing BlueJ as it has the visualisation of arranging the many classes such as the Mino classes which had several subsections in general. The beginner class to run the code is in the Main class which starts the whole game which is contianed within a single window with point counter and level counter on the right and the name on the left. Intense colours are used so be aware if you have sensitive eyes.
